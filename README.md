# Async Rust Projects

Welcome to the **Async Rust Projects** repository! üöÄ This collection of projects is designed to help beginners understand and practice asynchronous programming in Rust.

## üìö Projects Overview

| #   | Project Name               | Description                                                     | Topics Covered               |
| --- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | [Web Scraper](./project-1-web-scraper)   | Concurrently fetches data from multiple websites.               | Async HTTP requests, Tokio   |
| 2   | [File Processor](./project-2-file-processor) | Processes multiple files using async file I/O.                  | Async file handling          |
| 3   | Chat Server                | Implements a TCP chat server with async networking.             | Async networking, sockets    |
| 4   | Task Scheduler             | Executes mixed workloads with async tasks and threads.          | Async tasks, thread pools    |
| 5   | HTTP API Gateway           | Handles concurrent HTTP requests with async runtimes.           | Async I/O, HTTP handling     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Rust (latest stable version)  
- Async runtimes: `tokio`, `async-std`, etc.  
- Additional libraries as specified in each project folder.

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/upendra-eth/async-rust-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd async-rust-projects/project-1-web-scraper
   ```
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## üß† Learning Goals
Each project focuses on key aspects of asynchronous programming, such as:
- Efficient concurrency with async runtimes.
- Handling I/O-bound tasks using async I/O.
- Mixing async with threads for optimal performance.
